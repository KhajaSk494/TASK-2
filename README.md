# Overview Of This Project

## Project: API Testing with Postman and Newman

## Objective

### To Automate API Testing Processes to Ensure Reliability and Functionality of APIs, Such as RESTful APIs.

# Project Activities

## Project Planning and Setup

- **Determine the Goals of the Testing Project:**
  - Define the primary objectives of the API testing initiative.
  - Establish what success looks like for the API testing efforts.

- **Identify the APIs to Be Tested:**
  - List out the APIs and endpoints that need to be tested.
  - Ensure all critical API functionalities are covered in the testing plan.

## Test Design and Strategy

- **Create Postman Collections for API Testing:**
  - Develop Postman collections that include requests and expected responses.
  - Organize collections to cover different aspects of the API.

- **Develop Test Scripts in Postman:**
  - Write test scripts within Postman for each API request to validate functionality and performance.
  - Include assertions to check response status, content, and other relevant metrics.

## Test Execution and Validation

- **Export and Run Postman Collections Using Newman:**
  - Export the Postman collections as JSON files.
  - Use Newman to run these collections in a command-line environment for automated testing.

- **Monitor Test Execution for Any Issues or Failures:**
  - Observe the execution of Newman tests and check for any errors or unexpected results.
  - Address any issues encountered during testing and verify resolutions.

## Reporting and Analysis

- **Generate Test Reports:**
  - Use Newmanâ€™s reporting features to produce detailed test reports.
  - Include test results, logs, and screenshots (if applicable) to provide a comprehensive view of the test outcomes.

- **Analyze Test Results:**
  - Review the test reports to analyze the results of the API tests.
  - Identify patterns in test failures, investigate root causes, and document findings.
